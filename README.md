# Holberton School Sorting Algorithms

## Description

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms. The project is designed as part of the Holberton School curriculum and aims to deepen the understanding of sorting algorithms through C programming.

## Sorting Algorithms

This repository implements the following sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Counting Sort
- Shell Sort

## Installation

Clone this repository using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HitteAnzo/holbertonschool-sorting_algorithms.git
```

## Compilation

To compile the sorting algorithms, use gcc with the C source files:

```bash
gcc -o sort algorithms/*.c
```
Replace algorithms/*.c with the specific files you wish to compile. Be sure to include the necessary header files for your project.

## Usage

After compiling the project, you can run the sorting algorithms from the command line. Arguments may include options to specify the type of sort or the inputs to be sorted. Check the source files for more details on how to use each algorithm.
